  Three people check into a hotel room.  The bill is $30 so they each pay $10.  After they go to the room, the hotel's cashier
  realizes that the bill should have only been $25.  So he gives $5 to the bellhop and tells him to return the money to the
  guests.  The bellhop notices that $5 can't be split evenly between the three guests, so he keeps $2 for himself and then
  gives the other $3 to the guests.


  Now the guests, with their dollars back, have each paid $9 for a total of $27.  And the bellhop has pocketed $2.  So there
  is $27 + $2 = $29 accounted for.  But the guests originally paid $30.  What happened to the other dollar?


  Is $27 + $2 really the correct math?
